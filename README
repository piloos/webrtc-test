qtwebrtcendpoint
 * application creating a gstreamer pipeline which serves as a webrtcendpoint
 * expects a websocket signaling server

qtwebsocketserver
 * simple websocket sever relaying messages between two or more clients

webserver
 * html + js to configure a Chrome browser as a webrtcendpoint

certs
 * self-signed x509 certificate + private key which can be used during setup of the https and wss server


How to setup the project:
 * build the qtwebsocketserver application
 * run the qtwebsocketserver appliction with '-d -s' (debug and secure)
   - by default the server will listen on port 1234 (use -p <port> if you hate port 1234)
   - in the main.cpp the certificate location is hardcoded: /home/lode/keystuff/server.pem and /home/lode/keystuff/server.key
      --> change and recompile if you have other locations (eg. the certs directory)

 * build the qtwebrtcendpoint application
 * run the qtwebrtcendpoint application
   - in the main.cpp the wss url is defined as wss://localhost:1234, you will need to recompile if you want to use another port

 * setup a secure webserver serving the files from the webserver directory
   - you can use the certificates from the certs directory
 * browse to the correct file and start the webrtc session
